        <h2>Demo 1: Inefficient Animation (Layout Thrashing)</h2>
        <p>
            This animation intentionally reads and writes layout properties in a loop, forcing the browser to recalculate styles on every frame.
            <strong>To analyze:</strong> Open the Performance panel, record a few seconds of the animation, and ask the AI to explain the "Forced Reflow" or "Layout Thrashing" warnings.

        <h2>Demo 2: Slow Table Re-render</h2>
        <p>
            This large table re-renders completely every time you edit a single cell.
            <strong>To analyze:</strong> Open the Performance panel, start recording, edit a cell in the table below, and then stop recording. Find the "Long Task" and ask the AI to explain why it happened and how to optimize the code.
